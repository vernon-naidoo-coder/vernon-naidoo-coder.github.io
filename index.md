# The Code Journal

Ever woke up one morning, looked at your code and wondered *What the hell did I do here?*

Ever search frantically through all your repos looking for that one piece of code that you wrote a few months back?

We've all been there, done that **and** bought the t-shirt. I finally decided to pull all those bits (*pun intended*) together in one place. And maybe add some explanations for mere mortals (like me) to understand. I hate it when some authors assume that you have been coding since you were four and therefore understand the most arcane code on the internet!

## So here it is...  
*my attempt to make the world a better place?*  
nah...  
just a place to collect all that code that I don't want to forget. And maybe somewhere where I can share the results of many hours of head scratching.
